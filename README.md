# Projets
These different personal projects were produced during my computer studies at the IUT of Lannion, these are all quite different, but remain roughly in a theme of cybersecurity and development.

The first one : Calculatrice
The is not a real big calculator but since it was my first really big program I admit to being rather proud of it. This therefore uses the <math> library and I created a separate file containing all the possible calculations. Its operation is explained directly during the launch.

The second one : Code_Ceasar
Contrary to what one might think, it is not the simple Caesar code but a kind of improved version based on the ASCII table and serving as a random variable and an encryption key to operate.

The tird one : Sentinelle
This bash program is similar to a Daemon allowing to constantly check if a file has been modified illegally and then sends back what has been modified and when precisely.
